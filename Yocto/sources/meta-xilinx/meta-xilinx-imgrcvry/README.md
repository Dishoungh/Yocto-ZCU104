# meta-xilinx-imgrcvry

This layer enables Image Recovery development metadata for poky, oe, meta-xilinx and
other layers.

# Building Instructions
This section describes how to build Image Recovery bin file with meta-xilinx-imgrcvry layer.

1. Set hardware MACHINE configuration variable in build/conf/local.conf file for a specific 
   target which can boot and run in the board.
```
MACHINE = "versal-vek280-sdt-seg"
```

2. Set DISTRO configuration variable as xilinx-image-recovery in build/conf/local.conf file
   to build image recovery .bin file.
```
DISTRO = "xilinx-image-recovery"
```

3. Build the tiny initramfs image using `bitbake` command.
```
bitbake image-recovery-tiny-initramfs
```

# Alternative Build Instructions
A machine may also include the provided enable-xilinx-imgrcvry.conf file similar to:

   include conf/enable-xilinx-imgrcvry.conf

Which will automatically configure the multiconfig system to include the appropriate
configuration for this layer.

The user may then use:
```
bitbake imgrcry
```

This will follow the steps and trigger a multiconfig build, and copy the resulting
binary into the default multiconfig.
